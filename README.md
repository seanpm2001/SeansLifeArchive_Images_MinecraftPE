# SeansLifeArchive_Images_MinecraftPE
The module for my life story project that contains my Minecraft Pocket Edition images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my Mineceaft session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en&gl=us) but when I originally played in 2011/2012/2013/2014, I played the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft/id479516143)

These daily pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images. You can learn more about Minecraft by [clicking/tapping here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us).

## Issues

### Current issues

#### Size concerns

I am currently concerned that the size of the project won't allow me to publish releases. This project is estimated to have beeen 10 and 60 gigabytes of data. I am worrying that if I were to publish a release, it would delete previous releases, or not let me, due to the GitHub 100 Gigabyte repository limit.

If anyone has proof of this being wrong, please send it to me via comment.

## Backup data and maps

I offer backup data of my Minecraft worlds for free download. I do daily backups after each session.

Due to the immense size of all backups together, each world has its own repository for backups. This project is currently incomplete, so most data isn't able to be downloaded.

***

## Difference between Bedrock and Java

There are some key distinctions between the Bedrock (C++) and Java editions of Minecraft.

The Java edition is the original edition, created by Mojang. Bedrock is the version written in C++ that is maintained by Microsoft.

Bedrock worlds and Java worlds are different in functionality, but receive the same content updates, but at different rates. Bedrock Edition is to be played on Microsoft devices, along with Android and iOS/iPhoneOS/iPadOS devices (for Pocket Edition)

### Major disaster experience with Java

Back in 2016, I ran into one of my biggest losses: after playing Minecraft nearly daily since 2012, my client got corrupted, and I lost all my worlds. I had over 1000 worlds being developed. I am determined to rebuild them in the future inside of a virtual machine when I get hands on separate copies of Minecraft 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.7.2, 1.7.3, 1.8, and 1.8.1.

## Photography expeditions

I have been making sure to get pictures of my worlds after getting back into the game in 2019.

### 2019

In late 2019, I began doing basic photography of my worlds, and later developed a pattern of photographing each structure after each day of work.

### 2020

I continued my photography patterns this month, but had some massive photography events, such as:

April-May 2020 - Got over 11000 pictures of all worlds, taking up over 50 gigabytes of space on my SD card. All worlds at the time were fully photographed for this.
