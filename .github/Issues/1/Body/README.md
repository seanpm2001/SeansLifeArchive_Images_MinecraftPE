### [Photography] Labmax photography skipped for the day (November 17th 2020)

I made an error this morning after backing up Minecraft by starting further construction without doing photography first. Official photography of labmax for backup November 16th 2020 is unavailable, I might fix this in the future, but if I don't, community photography can be done. Remember the general rules for acceptance:

> * Limited use of potion bubbles in pictures

> * Hotbar, hands, buttons, coordinates, and other overlays must be disabled

> * The world cannot be altered at all, not even by a single block

> * The whole structure has to be documented in order

> * Files must be 480p or higher resolution

> * Files can only be in common standard image formats, video documentation is done separately

> * Pictures cannot include other LAN or WAN players

> * Brightness should be set to 100

> * FOV should be set to a reasonable level accepted by the general public (70-75% FOV)

> * Image cannot be heavily saturated

> * Some other requirements not listed
